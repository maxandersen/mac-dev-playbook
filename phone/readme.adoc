= Script cleanup of iOS devices

1) Install `mobiledevice` via `brew install mobiledevice`

2) Run `mobiledevice list_apps | sort > existing_apps.txt`

3) Review the list - if unsure what app the keys represent run:

   `mobiledevice get_app_prop <identifer> CFBundleName`

4) Now run:
     `cp existings_apps.txt ok_apps.txt`


     and remove any apps from ok_apps.txt you don't want installed; keeping only the apps
     you think are ok.

5) Now you can run the following command to see what apps you
     have installed but are not ok with:

    `comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt`

    If you see anything you don't like to be removed, add it back to ok_apps.txt

 6) Now to delete apps you don't want run:

   `comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt | xargs -n 1 -t mobiledevice uninstall_app`


Congratulations - you now have a clean iPhone without too much manual hassle.
