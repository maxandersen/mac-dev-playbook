= Script cleanup of iOS devices

. Install `mobiledevice` via `brew install mobiledevice`

. Run `mobiledevice list_apps | sort > existing_apps.txt`

. Review the list - if unsure what app the keys represent run:

   mobiledevice get_app_prop <identifer> CFBundleName

. Run `cp existings_apps.txt ok_apps.txt`
  and remove any apps from ok_apps.txt you don't want installed; keeping only the apps
  you think are ok.

. Run the following command to see what apps you have installed but are not ok with.   If you see anything you don't like to be removed, add it back to ok_apps.txt


   comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt

 . Now to delete apps you don't want run:

   comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt | xargs -n 1 -t mobiledevice uninstall_app
   
Congratulations - you now have a clean iPhone without too much manual hassle.

Next time don't copy existing_apps.txt and you can just keep installing things to your phone and next time easily clean it up based on the ok_apps.txt.
