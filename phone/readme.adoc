= Script cleanup of iOS devices

. Install `mobiledevice` via `brew install mobiledevice`

. Run `mobiledevice list_apps | sort > existing_apps.txt`

. Review the list - if unsure what app the keys represent run:

   mobiledevice get_app_prop <identifer> CFBundleName

. Now run:

   cp existings_apps.txt ok_apps.txt

   and remove any apps from ok_apps.txt you don't want installed; keeping only the apps
   you think are ok.

. Now you can run the following command to see what apps you
   have installed but are not ok with:

   comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt
   
   If you see anything you don't like to be removed, add it back to ok_apps.txt

 . Now to delete apps you don't want run:

   comm -13 ok_apps.txt existing_apps.txt | xargs -n 1 -t mobiledevice uninstall_app
   
Congratulations - you now have a clean iPhone without too much manual hassle.
